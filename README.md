GameViewLayouter
================

**GameViewLayouter** is a small utility that layouts game views with multiple
displays. It creates multiple game view instances and place them so that they
cover the entire screens (excepting the main monitor). It's useful when running
the Unity Editor as a "kiosk mode" application.
